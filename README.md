# SteamKeyTrading
The final project I created for my Sophomore Lab in Applied Computer for Blockchains and Smart Contracts.
The project took in two keys for Steam games and had them submitted with their hash. This would then be verified by a third 
party to ensure that the keys were working. Once both keys were confirmed to be legitimate and submitted, the smart contract 
output the opposite keys to the people trading. There was additional search functionality of posting keys and the ability to 
create an account locate the trades you had posted. The webpage only works properly when running the ethereum network local on 
your terminal/command line and having the .sol file running, but the interface itself can be observed by opening the HTML doc.
